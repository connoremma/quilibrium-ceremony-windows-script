This is for windows MFs who have too much CPU

1. Clone script to the same directory as the ceremony client
2. Open Powershell in that directory and type `.\quilscript.ps1`
3. If step two fails at first, run powershell as administrator, and type `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`. Then close powershell, reopen, and try again.
